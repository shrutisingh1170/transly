  # Transly App Development


  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
  
```

## Deploying to Vercel

This project uses Vite. I added `vercel.json` so Vercel will run the build and serve the `dist` folder.

Steps to deploy:

1. Commit and push your code to a Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. For the project settings in Vercel:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`

No extra environment variables are required by default. If your app needs any (API keys, etc.), add them in Vercel's dashboard under "Environment Variables".
